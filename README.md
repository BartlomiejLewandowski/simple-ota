# Simple OTA (Over the Air)

## What is it

This is a simple solution for any OTA workflow that you can have in your IoT project.
There are a few components that are used in this workflow.

- An S3 bucket to store the files.
- Dynamodb table to store the metadata of the files.
- A serverless api to create new revisions of the files. (Admin upload)
- A serverless api to get the latest version of the file. (To be used by device to download)

The project contains a bin directory with the upload script.

## How to use it

### Prerequisites

- aws account (resources used fit in free tier)
- aws cli
- serverless installed

### Setup
Copy `.env.example` and fill in with your data. 
Run `sls deploy`

Once the API is ready, fill in the remaining env variables. Then use `./upload.sh` to upload files.

### Usage from device

Use any HTTP library to fetch the file metadata. 
The response will contain the latest firmware to fetch from AWS along with a timestamp signifying the upload date.
You can check to see if the device needs an update and if so, download the file and begin firmware update.

### Removing service

Run `sls remove`
